# NorwAir
Norwegian weather and air quality app
=======
NorwAir is a Kotlin-based Android app that displays the weather, temperature, and air quality in various Norwegian counties in real time.</br>
The data used for the app is gathered from the MET Norway's weather API, and NILU's air quality API.</br>
This app was made in collaboration with a team of 6, where we utilized agile methods such as Scrum to iteratively design a user centered solution in the span of 8 weeks.
